# Jensen Woodworking - UX & Navigation Review
## Professional Interior Designer Perspective

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This review focuses on **structure, flow, and navigation** to optimize the site for high-end residential clients and interior designers. The goal is to create a refined, trustworthy experience that minimizes friction and maximizes confidence.

---

## 1. RECOMMENDED TOP NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

### Current Order:
1. Home
2. About
3. Gallery
4. Services
5. Testimonials
6. Contact

### Recommended Order:
1. **Gallery** (move to position 2)
2. **About**
3. **Services**
4. **Testimonials**
5. **Contact**

**Rationale:**
- **Gallery first** (after Home) because it's the primary asset—interior designers and clients need immediate visual proof
- **About second** establishes credibility and craftsmanship story
- **Services third** helps visitors understand capabilities after seeing work
- **Testimonials fourth** builds trust after understanding what you do
- **Contact last** as the natural conversion point

**Alternative Consideration:**
If Home is always first, then: **Home | Gallery | About | Services | Testimonials | Contact**

---

## 2. IDEAL HOMEPAGE SECTION FLOW

### Recommended Structure (Top to Bottom):

#### **Section 1: Hero Banner**
- **Purpose**: First impression, brand statement
- **Keep**: Current slider with key messages
- **Enhancement**: Add subtle CTA overlay ("View Gallery" or "Explore Our Work")

#### **Section 2: Featured Projects Teaser** (NEW - replaces current "Selected Projects")
- **Purpose**: Immediate visual proof, drive to Gallery
- **Structure**: 
  - 6-8 high-impact project images in a clean grid (not carousel)
  - Title: "Recent Work" or "Featured Projects"
  - Single, prominent CTA: "View Full Gallery" → links to Gallery
- **Why**: Reduces redundancy—Home teases, Gallery delivers

#### **Section 3: About (Condensed)**
- **Purpose**: Establish credibility quickly
- **Structure**: 
  - Keep current split layout (image left, content right)
  - Reduce to 2-3 sentences + key credentials (30 years, location, philosophy)
  - CTA: "Learn More" → About page
- **Why**: Homepage should tease, not duplicate full About content

#### **Section 4: Services Overview**
- **Purpose**: Quick capability summary
- **Structure**: 
  - Keep current 2-box layout (Countertops/Islands, Tables/Mantels)
  - Add third box: "Repair & Refinishing" (currently missing from homepage)
  - Each box links to Services page (not Gallery)
- **Why**: Services page is where details live; Gallery is proof

#### **Section 5: Testimonial Snippet** (REPLACE current full carousel)
- **Purpose**: Social proof without overwhelming
- **Structure**: 
  - 2-3 testimonials in elegant cards (not carousel)
  - Show: Name, location, 1-2 sentence quote, project image
  - CTA: "Read More Testimonials" → Testimonials page
- **Why**: Homepage builds trust; full testimonials page provides depth

#### **Section 6: Contact CTA**
- **Purpose**: Clear next step
- **Structure**: 
  - Simple section with: "Ready to start your project?"
  - Single CTA button: "Get in Touch" → Contact
  - Optional: Brief contact info (email, phone)

## 4. SPECIFIC FLOW IMPROVEMENTS

### **A. Reducing Redundancy Between Home and Gallery**

**Current Problem:**
- Homepage "Selected Projects" carousel shows same content as Gallery
- Services boxes link to Gallery (confusing—should link to Services page)
- Too much project content on Homepage dilutes Gallery's purpose

**Solution:**
1. **Homepage**: Show 6-8 featured projects in static grid (not carousel)
   - Title: "Featured Work" or "Recent Projects"
   - Single CTA: "View Full Gallery" → Gallery page
   - Purpose: Tease, not compete with Gallery

2. **Gallery Page**: 
   - Remove "Selected Projects" language (implies partial view)
   - Title: "Gallery" or "Our Work"
   - Show ALL projects with filters
   - Clear CTA: "Start Your Project" → Contact

3. **Services Links**: 
   - Service boxes on Homepage → link to Services page (not Gallery)
   - Services page can link to Gallery for examples

---

### **B. Testimonial Placement Strategy**

**Current Problem:**
- Full testimonial carousel on Homepage competes with Testimonials page
- No clear distinction between Homepage snippets vs. full page

**Solution:**
1. **Homepage**: 
   - Replace carousel with 2-3 elegant testimonial cards
   - Show: Name, location, 1-2 sentence quote, project image
   - CTA: "Read More Testimonials" → Testimonials page
   - Purpose: Build trust quickly, drive to full page

2. **Testimonials Page**: 
   - Keep current elegant grid layout
